# üìù Taskify - Task Management Web Application

Taskify is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can register, log in, and create tasks with different **priorities** and **statuses**, and dynamically update or delete them as needed.

---

##  Features

-  User Registration & Login (JWT Auth via HTTP-only cookies)
-  Add tasks with:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Priority: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`
  - Status: `Yet to Start`, `In Progress`, `Completed`
-  Categorized task display based on status
-  Update task status and priority dynamically
-  Delete any task
-  Protected Routes using Middleware
-  MongoDB data modeling using Mongoose

##  Installation & Running Locally

###  Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed
- MongoDB Atlas account
- Git installed






 Challenges Faced  
 
Cookie-based JWT auth setup: Ensured tokens were securely stored as HTTP-only cookies.


Cross-Origin Requests: Properly configured CORS and Axios to handle cookie-based communication between ports 3000 and 1000.


Task Priority Display: Made sure task priority is stored, displayed, and editable from both frontend and backend with Mongoose validation.


User-Specific Tasks: Used MongoDB population to link tasks to individual users.
