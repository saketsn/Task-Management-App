# 📝 Taskify - Task Management Web Application

Taskify is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) web application that allows users to manage their daily tasks efficiently. Users can register, log in, and create tasks with different **priorities** and **statuses**, and dynamically update or delete them as needed.

---

##  Features

-  User Registration & Login (JWT Auth via HTTP-only cookies)
-  Add tasks with:
  - Title
  - Description
  - Priority: `Low`, `Medium`, `High`
  - Status: `Yet to Start`, `In Progress`, `Completed`
-  Categorized task display based on status
-  Update task status and priority dynamically
-  Delete any task
-  Protected Routes using Middleware
-  MongoDB data modeling using Mongoose

##  Tech Stack

###  Frontend
- [React.js](https://reactjs.org/)
- Axios (API requests)
- React Router DOM (Page routing)
- Tailwind CSS (UI Styling)
- useState, useEffect (State & Lifecycle Management)

###  Backend
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Express.js](https://expressjs.com/)
- bcryptjs (Password hashing)
- jsonwebtoken (JWT authentication)
- cookie-parser (Cookie management)
- CORS (Cross-Origin Requests)

###  Database
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) with [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/)

- Git installed

###  Steps

#### 1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/taskify.git
cd taskify

2. Backend Setup:
cd server
npm install

Create .env file:


env
MONGO_URL=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key

Run the backend server:



nodemon app.js

3. Frontend Setup:
bash
CopyEdit
cd client
npm install
npm start

Frontend runs at: http://localhost:3000

 Challenges Faced
Cookie-based JWT auth setup: Ensured tokens were securely stored as HTTP-only cookies.


Cross-Origin Requests: Properly configured CORS and Axios to handle cookie-based communication between ports 3000 and 1000.


Task Priority Display: Made sure task priority is stored, displayed, and editable from both frontend and backend with Mongoose validation.


User-Specific Tasks: Used MongoDB population to link tasks to individual users.
